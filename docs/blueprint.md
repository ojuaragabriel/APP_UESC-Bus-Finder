## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to give a feeling of competence and utility. This darker color helps the important UI elements to be noticed easily.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) to work well in either a light or dark theme.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#9400D3) to help important elements and badges stand out clearly.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clear, modern, and readable interface.
- Use simple, directional icons (arrows) for 'To UESC' and 'From UESC'.
- Group schedules by hour with clear headers, and use concise cards for each schedule.
- Subtle animations for auto-scrolling and badge updates to provide a smooth user experience.
